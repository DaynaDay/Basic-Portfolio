# Basic-Portfolio

Usage

I created a basic portfolio page with a blurb about me and some faux images as well as a contacts page. The project required three pages that one can navigate through using navigation tools. From the main header on the right-hand side, the viewer is able to access my portfolio which should lead to a gallery of images with text written across. The contacts page should take the viewer to a page layout in which you are able to leave a name, e-mail, and message for correspondence.  

Trials and Errors

There were many difficulties while writing the code for this page layout.
I used flexbox for the main header but it seems to not have taken. At first, I believed it to be because I was missing quotations, as that was my main issue when first using CSS. When the suggested lines of code did not work I tried to use the style format. That function seemed to only minutely affect the structure of the header as well as the navigation bar. while there was some sucess I was not able to fully intergrate the commands to match the actions need to correctly format the page.
